For each sequence, we get input in the form of a sequence of 3D motion vectors:
  s = [v1, v2, ..., vn]

We tokenize s into a sequence of motion *tokens*:

  T = f(s) = [t1, t2, ..., tm]

Score is based on edit distance from replay token sequence T' to original token sequence T

  score = levenstein(T, T')

To work out:

 * tokenization
 * 



Tokenization:
  Divide space into 27 not-really-quadrants
  Possible tokens are:
	* cardinal directions
//    * Directional movement (up, down, left, right, forward, back, any 3-tuple of above)
	* stationary
  Time-based? Record x,y,z at particular beats?
